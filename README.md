## Usage
This repo was practice for React Todo. I want to go back and break down what was learned, so I can read documentation and build more React stuff solo.

If you follow along with the credited tutorial, you will learn about some of these topics:
- React
- Components
- Folder/File Structure
- Props
- State
- useState
- useEffect
- localStorage `(JSON.Stringify, JSON.parse, getItem, setItems)`
